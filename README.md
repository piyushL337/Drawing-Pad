# Drawing Pad
<p>The Drawing Pad is a simple drawing application.</p>

<p>
  You can draw with the help of the cursor. You just can draw the stuff but unfortunately cannot save this in the system.
  </p>
  <p>
  This is a runtime program. But instead, you can save your work by downloading it as an image.</p>
